# 🌱 SMART IRRIGATION AND FERTILISER SYSTEM 💧

This project is an **IoT-based Smart Farming Solution** that automates irrigation and fertilizer distribution using real-time environmental data. By integrating sensor readings, smart logic, and cloud-based monitoring, it supports **precision agriculture**, improves productivity, and conserves resources like water and nutrients.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The system leverages **soil moisture**, **temperature**, and **humidity sensors** to make intelligent decisions:
- Automatically waters crops when moisture is low
- Dispenses fertilizer when needed
- Streams sensor data to a live dashboard
- Enables remote access and control via a web interface

## 📦 Key Features

- 🌡️ Real-time sensor monitoring (Moisture, Temp, Humidity)
- 🚿 Auto-activated irrigation and fertilizer control
- 📈 Data visualization with interactive graphs
- 🌐 Web dashboard for live monitoring
- 📲 Remote control and alert notifications
- 🔐 Modular and secure architecture

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Sensors measure the environment and send data to the microcontroller.

2. **Decision Logic**  
   System evaluates if action is needed (e.g., turn pump ON).

3. **Action Execution**  
   Actuators are triggered to irrigate or fertilize based on logic.

4. **Data Transmission**  
   Data is sent to the backend for storage and visualization.

5. **User Interaction**  
   Dashboard displays current readings and system status in real-time.
